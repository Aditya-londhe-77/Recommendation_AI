## üí° Usage Examples

### Before Improvements:
```
User: "Show me RO systems"
Bot: "What's your budget? What capacity do you need? For home or office?"
User: "Under 50000"
Bot: "What's your budget? What capacity do you need?" [Repetitive]
```

### After Improvements:
```
User: "Show me RO systems under 50000"
Bot: "Here are RO systems under ‚Çπ50,000:

üè∑Ô∏è PRODUCT: ATROS Swift
üí∞ PRICE: ‚Çπ25,000
üìÇ CATEGORY: Domestic RO Systems
‚ö° KEY FEATURES: RO+UV+UF with TDS Adjuster

üîß TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Flow Rate: 15 LPH
‚Ä¢ Storage: 12-15 liters
‚Ä¢ UV Purification
‚Ä¢ RO Membrane included

‚úÖ SUITABLE FOR: Home, Office, Small families"

User: "What are the benefits of alkaline water?"
Bot: "üíß Alkaline Water Benefits:

üìä pH Level: 8.5-9.5 (vs regular water 6.5-7.5)

üî¨ HEALTH BENEFITS:
‚Ä¢ Better Hydration: Smaller molecular clusters for easier absorption
‚Ä¢ Antioxidant Properties: Helps neutralize free radicals
‚Ä¢ pH Balance: May help balance body's acidic levels
‚Ä¢ Improved Metabolism: Enhanced nutrient absorption
‚Ä¢ Detoxification: Assists in flushing out toxins

‚ö° HOW IT WORKS:
Alkaline water is created through ionization process that increases pH and adds beneficial minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium.

üí° OUR SOLUTIONS:
‚Ä¢ RO+Alkaline systems that provide alkaline water
‚Ä¢ Alkaline + Mineral cartridges for existing systems"
```
